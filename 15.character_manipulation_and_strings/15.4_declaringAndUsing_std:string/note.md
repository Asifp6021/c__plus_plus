introduction to std::string;

std::string is type which makes very easy to work with string data.

we have seen many way we can work with array character.

1. we can create raw character array.
2. we can create pointer char array

3. we can also create on heap dynamically.

character array have some problem which is much fustrating.

one of those is sizing we have to check how many character have in array. we have to define size or have to keep track that it is not going bounce.

and also we have to keep track of the null character '\0'.

it very annoying some time we just want to string character and we can't do it peacefully.

but don't worry c++ offers high type by which all the problem will be hidden we don't have to care about this.
