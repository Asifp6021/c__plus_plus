pointers are special kind of variable which stores memory addresses.

they accupies 8 bytes size in memory

suppose you have variable

int value =32 -> memory address is 1008

so i want to point or access the variable value's memory address for that we have to use pointers

int\* accessTheAddress = value;

when we use \* front of the variables type that means we are using pointers and we accessed or the stored the value's memory address inside the variable accessTheAddress.
