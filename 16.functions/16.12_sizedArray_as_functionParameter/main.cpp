/*
 we're going to learn about what happens when the array you pass as a function parameter has a size.

 double scores[5] <- if you look at this five here, you might think that the compiler is going to enforce for your parameters. to have five elements but that not the case.

 compiler allow you to pass any number of elements.

 if elements in array less then 5 or more then 5 still it is going to work.

 compiler going to ignore the size 5 that we have defined.

 because when we pass array as parameter to function it becomes pointer.

 so don't define the size of the array if you are passing it as function parameter.
