A mechanism to place constraints on your template type parameters.

we can use concepts to specify that we want to call function only with integer, string, double,

we could also use type traits for this as we seen but we are having to use assert in function body to compile it at compile time.

while practicing compare type traits syntax and concepts syntax.

but concepts are in built to achieve this behaviors. we don't have to use assert in will automatically get compile.

we have two way to use concepts.

1. standard built in concepts
2. custom concepts.
